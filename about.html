								<h1>Hakkımda</h1>
								<p><span class="lx-firstletter">D</span>escribed as a "child prodigy" and hailed as the first astrophysicist to win the Nobel Prize for a theory on the evolution of stars, Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar would have been 107 on Diwali this Thursday.</p>
								<p>In his honour, Google is changing its logo in 28 countries to a doodle, or illustration, of him and the Chandrasekhar Limit. But in his lifetime, the Indian American astrophysicist was not always recognised for his achievements. This is his story:</p>
								<h3>Intellectual family</h3>
								<ul>
									<li>Born in Lahore in 1910 to a Tamil family, Chandra was home tutored until age 12.</li>
									<li>In his autobiography, Chandrasekhar referred to his mother as "My mother Sita was a woman of high intellectual attainments."</li>
									<li>His uncle, Sir CV Raman, won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1930. </li>
									<li>Also in 1930, Chandrasekhar completed his bachelor's degree in physics at the Presidency College in Madras, India (known today as Chennai).</li>
								</ul>
								<blockquote>
									<p>What a scientist tries to do essentially is to select a certain domain ... and see if that takes its appropriate place in a general scheme"</p>
									<cite>S CHANDRASEKHAR, IN HIS BOOK TRUTH AND BEAUTY</cite>
								</blockquote>
								<p>In his book, Truth and Beauty, he offered his advice to aspiring scientists, "What a scientist tries to do essentially is to select a certain domain ... and see if that takes its appropriate place in a general scheme which has form and coherence; and, if not, to seek further information which would help him to do that."</p>
								<p>In his autobiographical sketch for the Nobel Prize ceremony, he described what motivated his scientific quest, "When, after some years of study, I feel that I have accumulated a sufficient body of knowledge and achieved a view of my own, I have the urge to present my point of view, ab initio, in a coherent account with order, form, and structure."</p>
								<ol>
									<li>In 1937, Chandrasekhar emigrated to the US and started working at the University of Chicago.</li>
									<li>During World War II, he was invited to join the Manhattan Project at Los Alamos to make a nuclear bomb, but delays in the processing of his security clearance prevented him from joining. </li>
									<li>Still, Chandrasekhar contributed to the war effort, working for the Ballistic Research Laboratory in Maryland. </li>
									<li>In 1953, 16 years after he came to the US, Chandrasekhar was granted US citizenship. He died in Chicago at the age of 85.</li>
